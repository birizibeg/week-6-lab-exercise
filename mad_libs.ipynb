One of them was to kill an elephant to sleep. After 1424124124 minutes, Evan was desperate because he didn't know how to start. But right at this very moment, Bob appeared out of nowhere and asked to team up with Evan. Fate had joined these two strangers together, and it blossomed into an awesome frienship.\n"
