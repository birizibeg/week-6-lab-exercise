## MAD LIBS

## DESCRIPTION 
This python program asks the user for a series of inputs, and makes an amusing story based on what the reader gives us. The story gets printed out for the reader to enjoy, and be done many times.

  ## CONTRIBUTING
 
  Contributions are appreciated, as long as they adhere to the rules that we have in place. 
  We chose to use the Contributor Covenant as our code of conduct. The Contributor Covenant is a well-known document that
  is  widely understood and signals to potential contributors our standards for the project without necessarily having to 
  read a new code of conduct - they very likely have already encountered the Covenant. It also gives some comfort to people
  who might feel discouraged from contributing that this project is a safe one and that there is a structure in place 
  to support them. The Covenant supports our stance that all contributors should act graciously and kindly to one another 
  and participate to the project for the good of the community as a whole and the members of it, and denounces those who would
  use damaging language or viewpoints.
  
  ## LICENSE 
  
  We use MIT license because it allows the distributors to share the code under a copyleft license without forcing to
  expose  their proprietary code. It is business friendly and open source friendly while allowing the space for monetization.
